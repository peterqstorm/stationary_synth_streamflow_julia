# Kirsch-Nowak_Streamflow_Generator

Code adapted by Peter Storm (pqs4@cornell.edu) into Julia from MATLAB code written by Matteo Giuliani, Jon Herman and Julianne Quinn and located here: https://github.com/julianneq/Kirsch-Nowak_Streamflow_Generator

Please use the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code. You can directly run the main.jl as well. You can easily find the user-inputs in the code itself, surrounded by a comment box. 

A full description of the theory behind the model can be found here: https://github.com/julianneq/Kirsch-Nowak_Streamflow_Generator/blob/master/ModelDescription.pdf

This is a Jupyter Notebook adaptation of the Kirsch-Nowak Streamflow Generator for stationary hydrology. For full documentation, please visit the following page: https://github.com/julianneq/Kirsch-Nowak_Streamflow_Generator/tree/master/stationary_generator

Please note that this model has not been validated at this time; it appears that there may be some errors in the outputs. Please contact me or flag an issue on GitHub if you are aware of what the issues may be.

This code was developed in and is subsequently stable using Julia V1.0.3.
